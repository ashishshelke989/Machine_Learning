Decision Tree Classifier - Case Study 

• Below application uses Decision Tree algorithm to classify the type of ball.
• In this application training set contains two types of balls.
• Features of our training set is weight and type of surface of ball.
• We are using two labels as Tennis and Cricket.
• We train our data set using Decision tree algorithm.

Consider below characteristics of Machine Learning Application :

Classifier : 			Decision Tree
DataSet : 				Balls Dataset
Features : 				Weight & Surface type
Labels : 				Tennis and Cricket
Training Dataset : 		15 Entries
Testing Dataset : 		1 Entry
